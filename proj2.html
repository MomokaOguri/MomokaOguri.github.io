								<h3>Objective</h3>
								<p>
									The primary goal of this project was to conduct an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset of global layoffs from 2020 to early 2023. 
									The analysis aimed to uncover patterns and insights related to the layoffs, with specific objectives including:
								</p>

								<ul>
									<li>Identify the most affected companies, industries, and countries</li>
									<li>Analyze layoff trends over the specificed period</li>
									<li>Understand the progression and impact of layoffs month by month</li>
								</ul>

								<h3>Dataset</h3>
								<ul>
									<li>Global Layoffs, 2020 - early 2023</li>

									<li><b>Fields</b>: company, location, industry total number of laid off, percentage of laid off, date, stage of company, country, and fund raised in miilions</li>

								<h3>Analysis & Findings</h3>
								<h4>Date range of data</h4>
								<p>
									Use <code>MIN</code> & <code>MAX</code> on date column to get the date range of data: Mar 11, 2020 to Mar 6, 2023. 
									This range includes key events such as the COVID-19 lockdowns and economic downturns in 2020 and the significant tech industry layoffs in 2023.
								</p>

								<h4>Companies that went completely under</h4>
								<p>Identify companies with 100% layoffs, indicating closure or total shutdown, using <code>WHERE percentage_laid_off = 1</code>.</p>

								<h4>Total laid off by vairous dimensions for the whole span in dataset</h4>
<pre><code>SELECT company, SUM(total_laid_off)
FROM layoffs_staging2
GROUP BY company
ORDER BY 2 DESC;</code></pre>									
								<p><img src="images/proj2_detail1.png" width="100%" alt="" /></p>
								<ul>
									<li><b>By company:</b> Major companies (eg: Amazon, Google, Meta, Salesforce, Microsoft) are in the top of the list.</li>
									<li><b>By industry:</b> Consumer, retail, transportation industries were most affected.</li>
									<li><b>By country:</b> US was significantly affected with respect to rest of the world: US had 257K layoffs and India was the second most affected with 36K layoffs. 
										It could be partly due to the data collection methods. However, since many of major companies like above are located in the US, the number seems justifiable.</li>
									<li><b>By year:</b> There are only 2 months of data for 2023 in the dataset, but it ranked as the most affected year out of the time period.</li>
								</ul>

								<h4>Progression of layoffs</h4>
<pre><code>WITH CTE_Rolling_Total AS(
	SELECT SUBSTRING(`date`,1,7) AS `MONTH`, SUM(total_laid_off) AS total_off
	FROM layoffs_staging2
	WHERE SUBSTRING(`date`,1,7) IS NOT NULL
	GROUP BY `MONTH`
	ORDER BY 1 ASC
)
SELECT `MONTH`, total_off,
SUM(total_off) OVER(ORDER BY `MONTH`) AS rolling_total
FROM CTE_Rolling_Total;</code></pre>
									
									<p><img src="images/proj2_detail2.png" width="100%"  alt="" /></p>
									<p>
										Rolling total of layoffs by month allows to gain insight into how the layoffs progressed over time. 
										The number of layoffs is significantly high in Apr and May of 2020, quickly pushing the total since start of dataset to 62K. <br />
										After that, there are no significant surge for about 2 years, and the total number reaches 100K in Feb 2022. 
										Some months with the lowest, double-digit number of layoffs fall into the data range: Mar, July, and Oct 2021. <br /> 
										From May 2022 to Feb 2023, the monthly layoffs rise to 5 digits, except for Sep 2022. 
										Nov 2022, Jan and Feb 2023 saw the exceptionally high monthly layoffs: 53.5K, 84.7K, and 36.5K, respectively.
									</p>								

								<h4>Top 5 companies by layoffs per year</h4>
<pre><code>WITH CTE_Company_Year (company, years, total_laid_off) AS(
	SELECT company, YEAR(`date`), SUM(total_laid_off)
	FROM layoffs_staging2
	GROUP BY company, YEAR(`date`)
), CTE_Company_Year_Rank AS (
	SELECT *, 
	DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY years ORDER BY total_laid_off DESC) AS Ranking
	FROM CTE_Company_Year
	WHERE years IS NOT NULL
)
SELECT *
FROM CTE_Company_Year_Rank
WHERE Ranking <= 5;</code></pre>

									<p><img src="images/proj2_detail3.png" width="100%" alt="" /></p>
									<p>
										The query uses two CTEs: first one to get sum of total layoffs by company and year, and 
										second one to add <code>DENSE_RANK</code> and filter NOT NULL years. It then filters top 5 companies in each year.
										<code>DENSE_RANK</code> allows to assign ranks numerically, instead of positionary, so that when there are tie, the next rank does not skip a number. 
										(eg: In 2023, Amazon and Salesforce both laid off 8,000 employees, ranking 4th. The next highest was Dell with 6,650 cuts, ranking 5th.)
									</p>
									<p>
										Combined with the progression result above, we can further derive insights for reasons of high number of layoffs in some months.

										In 2020, we see some companies in Transportation & Travel Industry (eg: Uber, Booking.com, Airbnb) ranked within the top 5 of most layoffs. 
										We saw earlier that the layoffs number climbed rapidly in Apr and May and then slowed down gradually. The findings can related to 
										restrictions on non-essential travels due to Covid lockdowns which likely caused cancellations and fall in revenue for business in the industry. 
										The subsequent slowdown of the layoffs number helps explain the cancellation numbers and related economic behaviors being normalized. 

										The top 5 most affected companies in 2022 and 2023 include many large companies in Tech Industry (eg: Meta, Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Salesforce). 
										The finding provides insights that they have largely contributed to the recent massive layoffs in 2022 through the end of the dataset in early 2023.
