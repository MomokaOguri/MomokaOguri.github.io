								<h3>Objective</h3>
								<p>In this project, I analyzed Airbnb listing data from 2016 to gain insights into listing competition by number of bedrooms and locations, and time of the year.</p>
								
								<h3>Dataset</h3>
								<ul>
									<li>Airbnb Listings 2016</li>
									<li>Source: <a href="https://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data/" target="_blank">Inside Airbnb</a>, <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alexanderfreberg/airbnb-listings-2016-dataset" target="_blank">Airbnb 2016 (Kaggle)</a></li>
									<li>Fields: id, listing url, name, neighbourhood, city, state, zipcode, country, latitude, longitude, 
										property type, room type, accomodates, bathrooms, bedrooms, price, availability, reviews</li>
									<li>Size: 3818 rows in Listings, 1.05m rows in Calendar, did not use Reviews data as it exceeds the Tableau processing limit</li>
									<li>Preprocessing: cleaned missing values</li>
								</ul>

								<h3>Visualizations & Insights</h3>
								<h4>Average Price per Bedroom (Bar Chart)</h4>
								<ul>
									<li>Viz choice: shows how price increases in ratio with the number of bedroom</li>
									<li>Data Transofrmation:</li>
									<ul>
										<li>Convert `Bedroom` column from continuous measure to dimension</li>
										<li>Aggregate average of prices by number of bedrooms - use sum of prices for insights into which number of bedrooms is most popular or brings in most money</li>
									</ul>
									<li>The average price of listings rises gradually with the number of bedrooms.</li>
								</ul>

								<h4>Distinct Count of Listings by Number of Bedrooms (Table Visual)</h4>
								<ul>
									<li>Viz Choice: Unlike average price per bedroom, it has a large difference in the number from 5 to 1,811 in only 6 elements. It would be visually simple and easy to see the degree of competitiveness in Table Visual rather than Bar Chart.</li>
									<li>The listings are significantly concentrated in 1-bedroom. Only around a quarter of listings for 2-bedroom, and the number of listings decrease further for listings with more bedrooms. There are only 5 listings for 6-bedroom. </li>
									<li>Combined with insight from the average pricing per bedroom, the more bedroom the listing has, the less competitive it gets and the higher the host can charge.</li>
								</ul>

								<h4>Price by Zip Code (Map Visual)</h4>
								<ul>
									<li>Viz Choice: Using Zip Code to visually analyze the geographical distribution of prices and highlight areas with notably high or low prices.</li>
									<li>All top 10 areas are within Middle & Midwest in the map. The lowest prices are along the most outer areas in the map. </li>
								</ul>

								<h4>Price by Zip Code (Bar Chart)</h4>
								<ul>
									<li>Viz Choice: Sort and use color graduation by average price by zip code. The same color graduation as Map Visual is used for comparison and deeper insights. </li>
									<li>From the map, it is hard to tell the degree of price difference between areas. From the Bar Chart, the Industrial District (zip code: 98134) is significantly more expensive the second most expensive neighborhood.</li>
									<li>The price difference is gradual from the second most to the least expensive neighborhood. </li>
								</ul>

								<h4>Revenue for the Year (Line Chart)</h4>
								<ul>
									<li>Viz Choice: Line chart for trend in revenue over the year for any insights into seasonal patterns or anomalies</li>
									<li>Data Transformation:</li>
									<ul>
										<li>Aggregate sum of prices on weekly basis</li>
										<li>Edit date range: Jan 1, 2016 to Dec 31, 2016</li>
									</ul>
									<li>Over Jan to Mar, the revenue is at the worst in the year. It quickly recovered in Jan and slowly rises to the annual average by Apr. </li>
									<li>Highest revenues around early summer at the end of May to June and year-end.</li>
								</ul>

								<h3>Reflections & Next Steps</h3>
								<h4>Learnings</h4>
								<ul>
									<li>Color coding across multiple visuals is very effective for further insights.</li>
								</ul>
								
								<h4>Challenges</h4>
								<ul>
									<li>The dataset is large and has several columns with similar details, especially geographical data, room details, and reviews. Deciding which columns to use and keep was challenging. </li>
								</ul>

								<h4>Further Improvements</h4>
								<ul>
									<li>Instead of zip code, show the neighborhood name</li>
									<li>Change the date label in the line chart to 1st date of each month while keeping data aggregated on weekly basis</li>
									<li>Make more interactive across all visuals: </li>
									<ul>
										<li>Apply filter of number of bedrooms to other visuals by selecting on bar chart</li>
										<li>Apple filter of zipcode or neighborhood to other visuals by selecting on either map or bar chart</li>
									</ul>
								</ul>
